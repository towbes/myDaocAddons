# Buttonmaster
An ImGui macro bar for daochook

## Special Thanks:

- SpecialEd over at RedGuides.com for making this great addon for Macroquest. https://www.redguides.com/community/resources/button-master.2174/  I started with this code and made some conversions so it would work with daochook Lua

## To Do:
- Make button colors work
- Change ini settings -> daochook settings library
